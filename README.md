# Ai-Sentiment-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is designed to streamline the process of identifying undervalued stocks and analyzing their sentiment using Python. By leveraging the `finvizfinance` library for stock screening and the FinBERT pre-trained NLP model for sentiment analysis, the project provides a comprehensive tool for value investors. The project automates the following tasks:

1. **Stock Screening**: Uses the `finvizfinance` library to filter and identify undervalued stocks based on specific financial criteria such as positive operating margin, low debt-to-equity ratio, low P/B ratio, low P/E ratio, low PEG ratio, and positive insider transactions.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes the FinBERT model to analyze the sentiment of recent news articles related to the identified stocks. This helps in understanding the market sentiment and media perspective towards these stocks.

3. **Data Output**: Generates CSV files containing the overview of undervalued stocks and sentiment analysis results for each stock, providing a comprehensive dataset for further manual analysis and decision-making.

The purpose of this project is to aid value investors in quickly identifying potential investment opportunities and gaining insights into the market sentiment surrounding these stocks, thereby facilitating informed investment decisions.
